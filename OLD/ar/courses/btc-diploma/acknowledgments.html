                The Bitcoin Diploma has been a wild success and one that has grown faster than anyone expected.
                We&apos;d like to give credit to all the wonderful people who got us here.

                rockstar. She has had great help along the way from some amazing contributors, including Gloriana
                Solano, Raul Guirola, Robert Malka, Giacomo Zucco, Gerson Martinez, Vriti Saraf, Madelyn Hereford,

                Napoleón Osorio, Victor Yasbek and Arel Edelkamp. Gerardo Apóstolo and Enrique Jubis, with
                ACTIVA, have also contributed with incredible design work.

                The Bitcoin Diploma story begins in February 2022 at a meeting at La Pacheco, a public school in San
                Marcos, El Salvador. Among those present were the school&apos;s innovative director, Asael
                Rodriguez,
                bitcoin education advocate and congressman Rodrigo Ayala, and the community builder for Ibex
                Mercado, Carlos Toriello, who invited other Bitcoiners, myself included, to come and tour the school
                and discuss Bitcoin education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Bitcoin Diploma began in April, with early support from Ibex as well as hundreds of
                individual donors. By June the first group of 38 students graduated at La Pacheco and we began to
                expand.
                Less than a year later, besides generous individual donors, we have a wide varietyy of sponsors,
                including Bitfinex, local mayors, and Bitcoin Beach, who help us simultaneously teach hundreds
                of students all over the country. The program more than doubles in size every ten weeks. In early
                2023 the diploma began to be taught in Guatemala with plans bring it to many more nations before
                the year ends including Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Ecuador and the United States. Donations
                from those programs will subsidize even more students in El Salvador.
            </p>

                The workbook has been open-sourced, is freely available and has been translated, printed out and
                independently taught to communities around the world, from South Korea to Uruguay.

                Mi Primer Bitcoin is a non-profit with a singular mission—to provide quality, impartial Bitcoin
                education to everyone in El Salvador as fast as possible. As the first nation to adopt Bitcoin we
                believe El Salvador will be an example to the world and that the foundation of success will be
                quality, impartial education. Our vision is to teach a nation and change the world. I know that
                sounds crazy,
                but I think we are on our way and the Bitcoin Diploma is a big part of that.
