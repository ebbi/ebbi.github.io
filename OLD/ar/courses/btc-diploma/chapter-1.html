                        <b>Bitcoin</b> has been called many things - a fad, a scam, “magic internet money.” But
                        behind
                        the
                        hype, there is a powerful technology that has the potential to change the way we think about
                        and use money; the potential to change the world in a way that “normal people” like you
                        and me have the opportunity to build wealth, become truly free and live the lives we want
                        to live. In this course, we will explore the flaws and limitations of our current financial
                        system
                        and how <b>Bitcoin</b> offers a potential solution. So, if you&apos;re ready to go beyond

                        headlines and learn about the real possibilities of <b>Bitcoin</b>, let&apos;s dive in!

                        Imagine you are stranded in a desert and you only have one bottle of water left. You are
                        thirsty
                        and
                        desperate for a drink, but you also know that you will need the water to survive until you
                        can
                        find
                        more. This is a classic example of scarcity - you only have a limited amount of a resource
                        (water)
                        and you must make a choice about how to use it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this situation, you might decide to ration it and take small sips over a longer period of
                        time,
                        in order to make it last as long as possible. Alternatively, you might decide to drink as
                        much
                        as
                        you
                        can in one go, hoping that the burst of hydration will give you the energy you need to find
                        more
                        water.
                        Regardless of which choice you make, you are faced with a difficult decision.

                            <b>Scarcity</b> forces us to weigh the pros and cons of how we use our resources and
                            make
                            trade-offs.

                    <p>
                        In this case, the choice is between quenching your immediate thirst and conserving the water
                        for
                        later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This concept of scarcity applies to all kinds of resources, not just water. Whether
                        it&apos;s
                        money,
                        time, or even love and attention, we are constantly faced with choices about how to
                        allocate our limited resources.

                            The main difference between the two is control. Centralized scarcity is controlled by a

                            entity, like a company or government, while decentralized scarcity is not controlled by

                        affects our choices and understanding it can improve our decision-making.
                        We
                        often have to choose between immediate gains and long-term benefits, and these trade-offs
                        shape
                        our
                        path to achieving our goals.

                            drink
                            all of
                            the water right away, even if it means that you won&apos;t have any left for later. This
                            is
                            because the thirst you feel right now is more pressing than the potential thirst you

                            For example, let&apos;s say you have the option to receive $100 today or $110 in a year.

                            you
                            have a high time preference, you might choose to receive the $100 today, because you
                            value
                            the

                        Have you ever stopped to think about what money really is? Ever even wonder what makes
                        money,
                        well,
                        money? Most of us know how to use it, but not many of us understand where it comes from or
                        how
                        it
                        works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Money is essentially a way to exchange goods and services. It represents the value of these
                        items in
                        a form that can be easily traded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This can take many different forms, such as paper notes, metal coins and electronic
                        payments.
                        Governments or other authorities typically issue and control money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But money is so much more than just a physical or digital medium of exchange. It&apos;s like
                        a
                        universal language that allows us to trade with people all around the world, even if we
                        don&apos;t
                        speak the same language or have the same culture. For example, you can be on the other side
                        of
                        the
                        world and
                        still “speak” money by placing a product on the counter and exchanging it for the local
                        currency
                        or
                        using
                        a credit card. Money is like a social contract that allows us to make exchanges without
                        having
                        to
                        rely on bartering or finding someone who specifically wants what we have to offer. If a
                        group of
                        people started accepting chocolate as payment for most goods and services, chocolate would
                        become
                        money. (Although, since it would melt in some parts of the world, we might consider it bad
                        money.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As French economist Jean Baptiste Say pointed out, “Money performs but a momentary function
                        in an exchange; and when the <b>transaction</b> is finally closed, it will always be found
                        that
                        one
                        kind of commodity has been exchanged for another.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, money itself dosen&apos;t have the power to satisfy human wants. It&apos;s
                        just
                        a
                        tool that allows us to trade one commodity for another.

                        When it comes to buying and selling goods and services, money is the key player. It has
                        several
                        important jobs, like:

                            <b>Making exchanges easier:</b> With money, you don&apos;t have to find someone who
                            wants
                            exactly what you have to trade. Instead, you can use money to buy and sell anything you
                            want. This makes
                            trading and commerce much more convenient and efficient.

                            express and compare the price of different goods and services. This allows for a more
                            efficient
                            and transparent market, where people can make informed decisions about what to buy and
                            sell.

                                    different dealerships and make an informed decision about which one to buy based
                                    on
                                    the
                                    price in dollars. Without a unit of account, you&apos;d have to try to compare
                                    the
                                    value

                            determines which asset is used as money based on factors such as its stability,

                            divisibility, transferability,

                            To determine how well different items meet the specific characteristics of money, you
                            can

                            determine which one is best suited
                            to be a form of money.

                    When it comes to money, there are two main categories:
                    <b>
                        physical and digital.

                    </b>
                    we have three options:
                </p>
                <ul>

                            Fiat money
                        </b>
                        is what we use every day, like paper bills and coins. It&apos;s issued by the government and
                        accepted
                        as a medium of
                        exchange, even though it&apos;s not backed by any physical commodity.

                            Representative money
                        </b>
                        represents a claim on a physical commodity. Like fiat money, it can also be a paper bill
                        (i.e. a
                        gold or silver
                        certificate), but unlike fiat, it is backed by a physical commodity society considers
                        valuable.
                        This means, for example,
                        that a gold certificate worth one dollar can be traded for one dollar&apos;s worth of gold
                        at a
                        bank,
                        which used to be the
                        case in many countries.

                    are cryptocurrencies that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to an asset, like
                    the US
                    dollar. Some are
                    backed by physical assets and all are used as a way to store value or to make transactions
                    without
                    the volatility that
                    can be associated with other cryptocurrencies.

                    A currency operating without intermediaries is more efficient and beneficial for society. It
                    prevents a few individuals
                    from controlling the money supply, and concentrating their power.

                    However, finding a technology that facilitates secure transactions without relying on trust
                    between
                    parties has been a
                    challenge throughout history. To achieve this, a currency must be created that operates like the
                    internet, where control
                    is distributed among everyone and no one at the same time. This requires the agreement of all
                    parties, including those
                    who hold power, to relinquish control for the greater good.
