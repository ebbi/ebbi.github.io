                        Bitcoin will change the world. That is certain. What we get to decide is how.

                        Bitcoin is much more than digital money.
                        It can be a powerful force that will not only shape our future world, but our
                        future
                        selves. When used correctly,
                        Bitcoin can be a tool that empowers the individual. And I know that sounds vague
                        now,
                        but by the end
                        of this course you will have a basic framework
                        of the why and the how.

                        The foundation of ensuring that we make the right choices will be education. The
                        world
                        is changing. The choice you have is whether you decide how it changes or you let
                        someone
                        else decide for you.

                        It is essential to have a firm grasp on the basics of money, its history, and the
                        current financial system before studying Bitcoin. Understanding these
                        concepts provides a strong foundation for comprehending the unique and disruptive
                        nature
                        of Bitcoin. By learning about the evolution of money,
                        you will be able to better understand the potential and limitations of the current
                        financial system and how Bitcoin aims to address them. Without
                        this foundation, it may be challenging to fully appreciate the significance and
                        potential impact of Bitcoin. Trust the process of learning and stay
                        focused, as the reward of a deeper understanding and appreciation of this
                        cutting-edge
                        field will be well worth it.
