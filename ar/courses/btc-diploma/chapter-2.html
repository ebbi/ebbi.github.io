                <h3>2. Introduction</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>The concept of money has evolved over time. In its early forms, money was used to facilitate
                        trade and exchange of goods and services.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In ancient civilizations, people relied on bartering, a system of direct exchange of goods
                            and services without the use of a medium of exchange.</li>
                        <li>Later, metal coins and paper currency were introduced as more convenient forms of money,
                            paving the way for the sophisticated financial systems we have today.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-alignment-center"><img alt="notice"
                            src="/courses/btc-diploma/images/money-history.png" width="650"></p>
                    <p>In this chapter, we will embark on a journey through time, experiencing the evolution of money
                        firsthand. We'll trace its origins and observe how ti has changed and adapted through history.

                <h4>2.0.1 Class Exercise: Barter Game</h4>
                <div>
                    <p><b>&bullet; #1 - Barter</b></p>
                    <p>It is the year 6000 B.C.E. Needless to say, money as we know it has not been invented. You are in
                        Mesopotamia and directly exchange goods and services with one another through <b>bartering</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="notice">
                        <img src="/assets/images/notice.png" alt="notice" width="20" height="20">
                        As a side-note, many businesses still accept non-monetary payments for their
                        services, and governments treat these bartered transactions the same as currency transactions
                        for tax-reporting purposes.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cut your sheet of paper at the dashed line. Your goal is to trade away your "have" as many
                            times as you need to finally get your original "want". You cannot change your original
                            "want". You will have 5 minutes to accomplish the goal of this exercise.</li>
                        <li>
                            When your new "have" matches your original "want", return to your seat. After the time is
                            up, if you have not found a trading partner, return to your seat anyway.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Fast forward and travel to the western coast of Africa sometime around the 14th century BCE.
                        Bartering has become tedious and inefficient. We have evolved as a civilization and are now
                        using <b>commodity money</b>.</p>
