What is the best approach to update the existing App that used a previous JSON model to 
be updated to the new version of the JSON data?

Here are the main changes:

Version 2 adds JSON objects:
metadata - currently not used in the App
vocabulary - allows for words array to use an id to the single copy of the word in vocabulary.

"blocks" in version 1 is renamed "content" in version 2

Version 2 standardizes JSON grammar definition with 
"pattern" and "example" (example was "note" in version 1)
The grammar book icon should be rendered inline before the heading.

Version 1 "type": "grammar-intro" has been deprecated and is not used.

"activities" in version 1 has been remodelled in version 2.
In version 2, "activitySettings" is defined once and 
any section types, word or paragraph can now have: 
"activity": { "inherit": true } to inherit the corresponding word or sentence activities in the "activitySettings"
If the "activitySettings" also has "activity": { "inherit": true } then the activity is inherited at document level.

For "activity": { "inherit": true } in the content, "type": "words" uses the words from the "wordIds" array. 
For "activity": { "inherit": true } in the content, "type": "paragraph" uses the words from the "wordIds" array and the "source" and "translations" sentences.
For "activity": { "inherit": true } in "activitySettings" uses all the words and sentences in the entire document.

The activities buttons are displayed at the top (below any heading) of the section where they are defined.
