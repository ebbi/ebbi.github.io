Restoring functionality for the new version and fixing one issue at a time.




http://127.0.0.1:8080/#quiz/test_all_features/multipleChoiceWord

Most of the Quiz styles have been reinstated except for 
the answer button in dark mode have black text on dark blue background.

You will now suggest a snippet CSS change again! 
And I am not sure what else is broken in the same way.

But, the worrying part is why has the original CSS styling that took so long 
to perfect just disappear?  

Would it help if I uploaded the version 1 of style-v1.css and app-v1.js so 
that the current versions can be validated?


Much time is being spent on finding CSS snippets that often already exists! 
I can see further polluted code with unnecessary !importnat ...
This simple return of an X to the quiz form has taken over 3 hours! 
and we have lost the original context and the original planned changes.

The data model is also much more complex to generate and on balance 
not worth the additional functionality.

There is 4284 lines of code in app.js version 1 and the new version has 2550 
lines of code ?!! 

I can not reconcile this with the suggested snippet changes.










Renders:
1. The document title from the manifest.json file which for this example is: 
Complete Feature Test

2. Renders meta-data styled in badges which in this case are:
advanced v2.0.0 test comprehensive all-features grammar practice

The specific changes:

1. Place a standard arrow for opening a details panel before the document title.
Click event on the arrow should open a panel under the title to reveal the 
document description from the manifest.json 
Below the description, insert a row with the buttons for:
Words, Sentences, Game and Quiz
(this is the same as section controls except the data is for the whole document)

2. Delete the meta-data badges entirely.


The information icon i does hide/reveal the information panel but the icon 
has been placed incorrectly before the grammar rule and not the heading.

Again, the idea is to place an inline clickable icon before the document title,
(the title for this document is, Complete Feature Test ) and similarly before the data
section 


 Testing:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/#doc/test_all_features

This page has too much meta-data and options visible and needs a redesign.

The overall idea is to place an inline clickable icon before the document title 
(the title for this document is, Complete Feature Test )

Similarly, place an inline clickable icon before the sections heading 
(the section headings in this example are: )





For Fix 4: Fix the startFlashcards function (it's currently causing a loop)
The function has no logic! please provide the code.

startFlashcards(documentId, sectionIndex, type) {
    console.log('startFlashcards called', { documentId, sectionIndex, type });
    console.log('currentDocument:', this.state.currentDocument);
    
    // REMOVE THIS LINE - it causes a loop:
    // location.hash = `flashcard/${documentId}/${sectionIndex}/${type}`;
    
    // The actual flashcard start logic should be here
    // This function should be called after the document is loaded
},











Testing: http://127.0.0.1:8080/#doc/test_all_features

1. Bug Remains unchanged! - The overlay Recommended: Study, pops up and disappears quickly. 
It should remain visible until the user closes the pop out page.

2. the Gear icon is now visible but it does not load the settings overlay page!

3. Bug Remains unchanged! The flashcard Words loads:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/#flashcard/test_all_features/null/word

but it is a blank page.  Same bug remains!

4. Bug Remains unchanged! The flashcard Sentences loads:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/#flashcard/test_all_features/null/sentence

but it is a blank page.

5. Bug Remains unchanged! The Game click event loads:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/#sentence-game/test_all_features/null

but it is a blank page. Same bug remains!

It has been a very long session. I need to take a break!
