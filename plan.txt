For your suggested, Part 1: The "Essential Life" Conversational Corpus, 
please see the uploaded files for a language learning App.

Mapping your "Essential Life" Conversational Corpus to the App data model:

The "Essential Life" Conversational Corpus becomes an entry in the manifest.json file.
And each of your categories is defined as an entry in the "documents" array in the manifest.json file.

Each of your categories data is defined in a separate JSON datafile.
Each category JSON datafile would have a single entry in the JSON "sections" array.
And each of your "conversations" becomes a JSON "blocks" entry of "type": "paragraph", 
with individual conversation sentences defined as  "type": "sentence" in the "elements" array.

Before proceeding any further, please double check the above data mapping is correct.







Please generate the same JSON data structure file for The "Essential Life" Conversational Corpus.



The requirement is to create data files for conversations in everyday life.  
For examples, conversations with a dentist, hairdresser, bank staff and so on.

The number of sentences is dependant on the conversation, but a minimum of 50 or more 
sentences in each conversation seems reasonable.

The requirement is to develop the data for learning languages for everyday life.

Please list the number of conversations and the number of sentences in each conversation 
that would be sufficient for effective communication in daily life.  

Please suggest any alternative approach to learning a language for daily life.


Unless you have a better alternative suggestion, please 
generate a data file for each conversation.
