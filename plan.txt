Further improvements.

Position the inline grammar button before the heading.
It is currently right justified after the heading.

=======================================

The purpose of the App is to help to learn speak Thai for 
everyday life.

For proficiency, I am not sure, but 500 to 1000 words as vocabulary.

A data file with complete sentences that demonstrate the basic 
structure and Thai grammar.  But the context for the complete sentences 
should be everyday conversations between people and not individual contextually separate sentences. 

A data file with the most common sentences and again the context for the complete sentences 
should be everyday conversations between people and not individual contextually separate sentences. 

Any suggestions?



Both options A and B will be useful.  
 
While conversations are not directly modelled in the App JSON data structure, a conversation can be 
simulated by the order of the sentences in the data file.

Assuming no enhancement or changes to the current data structure and and the App code, 
can the data be generated for both options A and B? 

Excellent! Both options A and B will be useful.  Another question.  The App has a Constructing a sentence game, a flash card game for 
words and sentences and a multiple choice quiz for words and sentences.

The question is how many words / sentences should be included in each file to 
make it an effective learning experience?  Please advise.


Yes please, I would like both the progressive series and the thematic files.  Before you do that, 
please generate the manifest.json for the files already generated.


My school text follows an approach that may be useful for another set of data files.
Sentence structures (or grammatical structure) are introduced followed by 
example sentences for practice.   
Is this feasible?
