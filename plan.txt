Testing flashcard system with:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/#doc/grammar_present_continuous

The data sets for the flashcards are still incorrect!
For example, for section words, the flashcard shows: Card 1 / 343 which is incorrect.  Similarly, for the other data sets.
Also, the show answer does not show the selected translation selected in Settings!

The data sets for document level words and sentences are incorrect.
The document level words should only include the JSON "words" array in the entire document.
The document level sentences should include all "source" sentences with the flashcard answers being the JSON "translations" 
(the selected translation(s) in the Settings show checkboxes should determine which translation is shown as the flashcard answer)


The data sets for section level words and sentences are incorrect.
The section level words should only include the JSON "words" array from the section.
The section level sentences should include only the section "source" sentences with the flashcard answers being the JSON "translations" 
(the selected translation(s) in the Settings show checkboxes should determine which translation is shown as the flashcard answer)





Exploring a new feature, Context-Aware Flashcards

Generate flashcards from words or sentences 

generateFlashcards() {
    const dueForReview = this.state.srs.dueItems;
    
    return dueForReview.map(item => {
        if (item.type === 'word') {
            return {
                front: item.word,
                back: item.translations[this.state.lang],
                example: this.findExampleSentence(item.word)
            };
        } else {
            // Sentence with cloze deletion
            const cloze = this.createClozeDeletion(item.sentence);
            return {
                front: cloze,
                back: item.sentence,
                translation: item.translations[this.state.lang]
            };
        }
    });
}

Please explain how this could be incorporated into the App and the 
typical user interaction.





Sentence Building Games

Drag-and-drop word ordering:
renderWordOrderGame() {
    const words = this.shuffleArray(this.currentItem.words.map(w => w.word));
    
    return `
    <div class="word-order-game">
        <div class="word-bank">
            ${words.map(word => 
                `<button class="word-tile" draggable="true">${word}</button>`
            ).join('')}
        </div>
        <div class="sentence-construction" id="sentence-construction">
            <!-- Droppable area for building sentence -->
        </div>
        <button onclick="App.checkSentenceOrder()">Check</button>
    </div>
    `;
}
