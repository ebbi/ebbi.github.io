For the next main use case, please provide a road map and advice on possible alternatives before generating any code.

The idea is to have a multilingual blog.  The App toolbar functionality remains the same.
The home page will have a new detail element "Books & Blogs" under the current Practice languages.

Within the details "Books & Blogs" there will be a search input box,
a drop-down select list of books $ blogs,
and a drop-down select list of languages available for the books $ blogs (the language list is updated for each blog)
Underneath, there will be a similar CS card display of the summary of latest blogs.
Blogs in different language would have common (as well as language dependant) resources such as images and video 

Approach suggestions?
