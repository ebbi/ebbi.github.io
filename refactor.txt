The other main refactor from yesterday that needs reinstating:

On loading an exercise:
1. read the exercise language from the exercises.json
2. If the browser doe not have the voice 
for the exercise, pop up a message to the user to follow the 
steps in Help to install the voice and redirect to the help page.

Or if the voice exists, set it to be the current voice and speak out 
a message voice set for the exercise.

The general case for any voice change should be a spoken message,
voice changed to ( and the name of the voice ).

​
Logic for the multiple choice tests again
1. drop down list for user to select the question language
- didn't do this? !!!
2. drop down list for user to select the answer languages
- didn't do this? !!!!
3. loop through each element of the question array and display the question
(speak out the text)
- didn't do this? !!!!!!
4. display 4 random answer language elements from the answer array
(speak out the answer words as they are displayed)
- didn't do this?!!!!! (words are from a mix of languages1111)
5. all words in question and answer have a click event to speak out the text
- didn't do this!!!!!
6. allow the user to try a click, speak ou the text,
highlight the selected text for 2 seconds, update the score and move to the next question

This feels is randomized failure.

A drop down list that freezes after the first selection fr the first language
second language is a long list and the selection is ignored with 
the answer randomized with different languages.

Random start button has appeared

etc.

Your response seems to be based on searches closest to the requirements.

Please find a popular multiple choice code base that is for two languages
and uses sound feedback and keeps a score.



✅	Action	What you’ll get
1️⃣ Fix the language selectors	Ensure the question‑language dropdown actually changes the language used for the prompt, and that the answer‑languages multiselect is respected when building the four answer options.	
2️⃣ Keep answers in a single language	Generate the four answer buttons only from the languages the user selected (no mixing of unrelated languages).	
3️⃣ Eliminate the “btn is undefined” crash	Guarantee that the four answer buttons always exist and are correctly indexed, so the click handler never accesses an undefined element.	
4️⃣ Preserve the existing SPA flow	All changes stay inside the current files (multipleChoiceExercise.js, routes.js, router.js, menu.js, etc.) – no new standalone pages or extra HTML files.	
5️⃣ Add score handling & 2‑second highlight	Highlight the chosen answer for 2 s, then evaluate, update the “Correct / Total” score, and enable the Next button.	
6️⃣ Provide a minimal, copy‑paste patch	A concise diff (just the lines that need to be changed/added) that you can apply directly to your repo.	
7️⃣ Test‑ready verification steps	Instructions on how to restart the dev server, clear the cache, and confirm the fix works (network tab checks, UI behavior).	
8️⃣ Ongoing support	If after applying the patch something still misbehaves, I can walk you through the next debugging step without introducing new features.


Attempt 2: (18:10)
Selected Question and Answer languages
CLicked start
Selected an Answer triggers Sound feedback 
but incorrectly displays feedback message: Paused 
Then all buttons become inactive
ANd finally the browser give up with the message:

For final testing:

1. After Start test
Set low opacity to inactive controls
2. Play and Paused are misleading, 
it seems Play is when there is a correct answer and Paused for incorrect 
in which case display correct and incorrect
3. Given there is a Next button now, the 2 second is redundant.
stop any delay
