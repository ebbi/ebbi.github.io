A previous refactoring has left the uploaded App with a bug.

The changes centered on the function buildTokenColumn(thaiWord, translations, langs) 
in the app/util/speechController.js

This function builds the columns of Display and Speak checkboxes with events to display and/or speak the selected text from translations

The refactor was to generalize the function to be language agnostic.  
That means the first parameter "thaiWord" is just another translation and can be added as the first element of the translations array.

Much of the current code dealing with the thaiWord can be deleted.
The function should be language agnostic with and array of translation in languages to be selected for display / speak

The function could be simplified to:  buildTokenColumn(translations, langs) or 
left as buildTokenColumn(thaiWord, translations, langs)  and thaiWord prepended to the translation array.
translations should now contain the thaiWord as the first element of the translation array

The logic is now simply:

1. loop through translations adding the language name, checkboxes for Display, checkbox for Speak under their respective headings
2. By default, set the first row of the 2 checkboxes as checked and display its translation span (add the lang attribute to the span) in the display div 
3. User selection of the checkbox (including the first row) should add or remove the translation span from the display div
(the array of span being hidden / revealed leaves a gap unsuitable for small displays )



I am using VSCode and it is problematic with diff patches.  Please generate find/replace code


A clean start with cache cleared and started server:
The Language options has the first language checkbox for Display and Speak selected
The main display div is blank (it should have the span for the first translation)

5 hours yesterday.  Similar problem now.  The first record is shown now 
But the checkbox change events are inactive and do not update the main div display for any of the languages
This is a self contained and entirely th code you just genera


This logic has failed for the last 2 days and repeats the bug because:

 "translations.forEach((txt, idx)" creates and entire set and yet the 
 selections of checkboxes is only the first element!!!

"translations.forEach((txt, idx) =>"
The first step in the function causes the bug by creating the 
 entire dataset of spans and only the first translation is checked for display.

 Instead:
 1. the initial first display should only output the first element of
 the array translations because as an initial condition only the first checkbox
 is checked and the remaining translation checkboxes are set to false.  
 No loop, just the first element of translation in the display div as the initial display.
 
 2. With each user checkbox selection you update the display array and update the display div
 (the number of spans in the array is determined  by the number of user selection of checkboxes
 with each selection/deselection of a checkbox the display array is updated accordingly and the display refreshed )

 So, 
 1. create a display array with a single element = translation[0]
 2. Display it and set the first checkbox to true
 3. checkbox event should add/subtract from the display array and update the display
