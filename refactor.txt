On the help page:

The details id="tts-android" has a summary element with text "tts-android".
Change the text to: "Setup Android for speech"
The text should be internationalized.

Generate the locale key value for the text for each locale.

The details id="tts-ios" has a summary element with text "tts-ios".
Change the text to: "Setup Apple Mac and Iphone for speech"
The text should be internationalized.

Generate the locale key value for the text for each locale.

Both above help content display embedded html and incorrect.
The content should be processed correctly as in the "How do I use the App?"

There seems to be two methods for creating a help file!
Replace this to a single method for adding to the help page.

-----------------------

The above changes has left the first two details panel empty of content.  The third details element has disappeared!!!
The summary text for the first panel "tts-android" 
has not changed to locale for "Setup Android for speech".

The same for second details panel summary "tts-ios"

Generate the entire help.js
hopefully with the corrections and return of the third details panel

------------------------------------

Pasted help.js and the helpRecords.js you just generated and the help page
now replaced the details summary text with the id values in helpRecords.js
And the details are empty.
