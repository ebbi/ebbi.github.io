Runtime bug after the last changes:

http://127.0.0.1:5500/en
Thai Test Data - Test Yourself 
<- Back to exercise 
Home
Thai Test Data - Test Yourself 
Loads Exercise instead of Test of test page

Bug 2:
Used Thai Test Data
Question does not match the correct answer

The version prior to todays changes is uploaded
before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js


1️⃣ Delete the stray menu copy.js
Done

2️⃣ Verify the router imports the correct menu file

Open app/router/router.js and check the import line near the top:

import { renderMenu } from "./menu.js";   // <-- should point to menu.js

!! app/router/router.js  does not access menu.js

But
app/ui/routes.js does and it is correct: import { renderMenu } from "./menu.js";  

The routing was stable before todays changes to the multipleChoiceExercise
I have reinstated the multipleChoiceExercise and its all fine

So, the problem is entirely in the new multipleChoiceExercise 
You have the old file uploaded, see:  before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js



Make sure “Use Regular Expression” (the .* icon) is turned on in the Find box.
VS Code returns error for regular Expression and in this case blank.

but it is clear the function renderQuestion() was to be replaced and done.

The problem is isolated to the changes today in the multipleChoiceExercise.js
as the previous file routing works.

Checking the navigation links in th browser at each step is the following:

Home button
() => {
  // Navigate to the root of the stored language (replaceState → no extra history entry)
  window.router.navigate(`/${getStoredLang()}/`, true);
}

Test Yourself
() => {
  const url = `/${UI_LANG}/exercises/${ex.id}/test`;
  window.router.navigate(url, true);
}

Back to exercise
() => {
  window.router.navigate(`/${uiLang}/exercises/${exId}`, true);
}

Home button
homeBtn.onclick = () => {
    // Navigate to the root of the stored language (replaceState → no extra history entry)
    window.router.navigate(`/${getStoredLang()}/`, true);
};

Test Yourself
() => {
  const url = `/${UI_LANG}/exercises/${ex.id}/test`;
  window.router.navigate(url, true);
}


Same problem.

BUT, when I change the multipleChoiceExercise.js to 
before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js

the routing loads the pages correctly.

Do you have a logical explanation for that?


Can we pickup the refactoring that has caused this runtime problem. To recap,

1. After the App starts up. "Test Yourself" events load the correct multipleChoice exercise.
  From the multipleChoice, Home icon loads the home page.  
Any subsequent "Test Yourself" loads the exercise and not multipleChoice page.

2. Rolling back with before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js and the problem is resolved.

3. You have generated the entire router.js and menu.js and tried to no avail

( one solution that may be less time consuming is to start with the 
before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js effectively rolling back the changes 
and carryout the few changes that were made again, each time testing the "Test Yourself" navigation )

The problem was the same as the the two json structures for numbers

This is incorrect:

[
    {
        "id": "num-1s",
        "category": "Numbers 1s",
        "en": [

            "نه",
            "ده"
        ]
    },
    more category ...
]

and not this:

[
  {
    "th": "ฉัน",
    "en": "I / me"
  },
  {
    "th": "ไป",
    "en": "go / travel"
  },
  {
    "th": "ตลาด",
    "en": "market / bazaar"
  },
  ...
]

Can you provide a script (to run in VS Code)
to group each language as it is in the first example.

node group-by-language.js thai_100_sentence_raw.json ai_thai_grouped.json

Can you please continue the fix from the last session. 

The task is to generate the complete, ready‑to‑use JSON that groups every Thai‑English pair supplied into parallel language arrays (th, en, zh, ja, fa).
The values in the arrays should be in their respective language, fa for Farsi, ja for Japanese, zh for Chinese.
All five arrays should the same length and order, so the dictionary / multiple‑choice engine can safely use the same index for every language.


The data set is now almost complete for final testing except one category 
 that was corrupted and needs to be regenerated.
 The task is to:
 1. loop through the following JSON "th" array and process each word by generating a grammatically correct Thai sentence and store the sentence in an array.
 This step has produced an sentence array that has a corresponding sentence with the th word array and the same index.
 In other words, th[0] has sentence[0] 
 2. Step one produces a new array of sentences.  Tokenize the sentence array into individual words.
 3. Use the new tokenized words array to generate the parallel language arrays (en, zh, ja, fa).
 All five arrays should the same length and order, so the dictionary / multiple‑choice engine can safely use the same index for every language.

Here is the "th" array JSON data:







The output you are generating is correct but you are repeatedly stopping before completion of all the arrays for the language codes.
You have had 5 attempts in the last hour and each time the output is incomplete and you hang part way through completing the conversion.
Perhaps, you could generate each language code array separately and I will concatenate.
Here is the JSON data to convert:

You have stopped at this point:
"fa": [
    "مدرسه / آکادمی",
    "باز کردن / شروع",
    "فردا / روز بعد",
    "معلم / استاد",

This is was the sixth attempt that took more than an hour of failed attempts to complete the task.
Please do not restart and hang again!!!!  Continue from this point to the end of the conversion output.


---------------------

Please stop, We spent much time yesterday with this mistake!!!!

This out should be in th, en, zh, ja, fa languages.  You are outputting English for fa which should be Farsi 
 and the same for zh which is Chinese and ja which is Japanese.
