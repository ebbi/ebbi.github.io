Runtime bug after the last changes:

http://127.0.0.1:5500/en
Thai Test Data - Test Yourself 
<- Back to exercise 
Home
Thai Test Data - Test Yourself 
Loads Exercise instead of Test of test page

Bug 2:
Used Thai Test Data
Question does not match the correct answer

The version prior to todays changes is uploaded
before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js


1️⃣ Delete the stray menu copy.js
Done

2️⃣ Verify the router imports the correct menu file

Open app/router/router.js and check the import line near the top:

import { renderMenu } from "./menu.js";   // <-- should point to menu.js

!! app/router/router.js  does not access menu.js

But
app/ui/routes.js does and it is correct: import { renderMenu } from "./menu.js";  

The routing was stable before todays changes to the multipleChoiceExercise
I have reinstated the multipleChoiceExercise and its all fine

So, the problem is entirely in the new multipleChoiceExercise 
You have the old file uploaded, see:  before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js



Make sure “Use Regular Expression” (the .* icon) is turned on in the Find box.
VS Code returns error for regular Expression and in this case blank.

but it is clear the function renderQuestion() was to be replaced and done.

The problem is isolated to the changes today in the multipleChoiceExercise.js
as the previous file routing works.

Checking the navigation links in th browser at each step is the following:

Home button
() => {
  // Navigate to the root of the stored language (replaceState → no extra history entry)
  window.router.navigate(`/${getStoredLang()}/`, true);
}

Test Yourself
() => {
  const url = `/${UI_LANG}/exercises/${ex.id}/test`;
  window.router.navigate(url, true);
}

Back to exercise
() => {
  window.router.navigate(`/${uiLang}/exercises/${exId}`, true);
}

Home button
homeBtn.onclick = () => {
    // Navigate to the root of the stored language (replaceState → no extra history entry)
    window.router.navigate(`/${getStoredLang()}/`, true);
};

Test Yourself
() => {
  const url = `/${UI_LANG}/exercises/${ex.id}/test`;
  window.router.navigate(url, true);
}


Same problem.

BUT, when I change the multipleChoiceExercise.js to 
before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js

the routing loads the pages correctly.

Do you have a logical explanation for that?


Can we pickup the refactoring that has caused this runtime problem. To recap,

1. After the App starts up. "Test Yourself" events load the correct multipleChoice exercise.
  From the multipleChoice, Home icon loads the home page.  
Any subsequent "Test Yourself" loads the exercise and not multipleChoice page.

2. Rolling back with before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js and the problem is resolved.

3. You have generated the entire router.js and menu.js and tried to no avail

( one solution that may be less time consuming is to start with the 
before--lumo--multipleChoiceExercise.js effectively rolling back the changes 
and carryout the few changes that were made again, each time testing the "Test Yourself" navigation )
