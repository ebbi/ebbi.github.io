Can you do a review and optimization or improvements?

I am using VSCode and it is problematic with diff patches.  Please generate find/replace code

The CSS code is inline in the HTML header and in app.CSS and defined inline by JavaScript.
Can you comment out (not delete) and optimize the CSS code 
with the preference for the minimum CSS in the HTML header
and the minimum CSS  defined inline by JavaScript
and the rest defined in app.CSS

Can you generate the code for the High (must‑do before next release)?

  For the Medium (quality & performance)	

  1. Extract repeated inline styles into CSS classes.

Please generate plain code to cut & paste

  2. Move speechPanel markup into a <template>.
  3. Add lazy‑loading to images in booksPanel.
  4. Introduce a simple i18n key‑audit script.
  5. Guard all localStorage accesses with environment checks.





Low (nice‑to‑have)	
1. Add ARIA roles/labels to toolbar buttons and form controls.
2. Implement a small focus‑management helper after navigation.
3. Write unit tests for router pattern compilation.
4. Add a timeout wrapper around fetch in loadJSON.
5. Provide a fallback spinner for voice list population.


One limitation is the default voice setting.  
Ideally,the voice selection should be updated at the time of selecting an exercise.
The exercises.json file has a "language" property defining the language for the exercise
and the App should load a voice for the same language.
If the voice is not available in the browser, a message should pop up to inform the
user that whilst the App will function but they should follow the instructions in the help 
and install the exercise voice.
The voice choice should also be persisted in local storage and set at App startup.

3 b) Update the call from the router

File: app/router/routes.js – modify the exerciseDetailHandler block that loads a dictionary exercise.

if (meta.details && meta.details.type === "dictionary") {
    const { initDictionaryPage } = await import("./dictionaryExercise.js");
    // Pass the exercise's language (meta.language) so the UI can pick a voice.
    await initDictionaryPage(lang, id, meta.language);
    return;
}

I think you mean app/ui/routes for the above.

Can you outline a new multiple choice exercise to be integrated.
The idea is the user typically learn a new language using the dataset for the dictionary exercises.
THe multiple choice exercise would be generalised to select any 2 languages from the same json data set
displaying the text from one language and 4 randomly selected text entries from the second language
only one of which is correct.
Feedback would be highlighting correct / incorrect answers.  
Clicking any word would speak it out
An overall score
Each Dictionary exercise card entry would then have a link to Test Yourself that would loadup the 
multiple choice exercise

Before generating any code, advice on approach and finalising a design would be nice.
