On the main home page:
1. Fit the Basic, Intermediate, Advance check-boxes fir in a single row on mobile displays
2. A check box selection currently adds the font selection as well as the newly selected checkbox exercise is appended to the bottom of the current display.  
Instead, display the font select list and the Basic, Intermediate, and Advance checkboxes to appear as a page nav only once. Then on every selection (or deselection) of a checkbox, display the corresponding exercises only one.
